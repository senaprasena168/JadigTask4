Fourth Assignment:
Next.js Fundamentals

This assignment focuses on building a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using Next.js. The goal is to demonstrate your understanding of API routes and client-side data management within a Next.js environment.

Task 1: Create API Endpoints
Create API endpoints at /api/products (or a more suitable path based on your chosen resource) that support the following CRUD operations:

Retrieve all data: Fetch a list of all products.

Add new data: Create a new product entry.

Update data: Modify an existing product entry.

Delete data: Remove a product entry.

Data Storage: Data should be stored in a static array (similar to the user examples from the fourth class meeting).

Data Structure: The product data should have the following structure: { id, name, price }. Feel free to adjust these fields if they are more relevant to your chosen resource.

Task 2: Build Front-end Pages
Create a front-end page at /products (or a relevant path for your resource) that interacts with the API endpoints you created in Task 1. This page should include the following features:

Display data list: Show a list of all products.

Add new data: Provide a way to add new product entries.

Update data: Allow users to modify existing product entries.

Delete data: Enable users to remove product entries.

Submission
Submit the GitHub repository link to the LMS.

Notes
Resource Flexibility: You are not limited to "products." Feel free to use any relevant resource such as "books," "students," or other data that fits your application's context.

Ephemeral Data: The data will be lost when the server restarts because it's stored in a static array. This is acceptable for this assignment.
